# Music-Scraper
thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75485470/how-to-scrape-the-specific-text-from-kworb-and-extract-it-as-an-excel-file btw

`get_artist_links.py` -> `get_song_ids.py` -> `merge_songs_with_links.py` -> `get_song_data.py`


ToDos:

- [x] download all songs for artists
- [x] check if songs fit the ones we look for
- [x] create xmas song list with rank and spotify ID
- [x] check if weekly data usw is available for ID
    - check daily?
- [x] download weather data
- [ ] clean weekly data -> split into positions and streams
- [ ] manual adding not matched songs to xmas and breakup list
- [ ] check other spotify dataset from kaggle, maybe better?
